    <p> Hello everyone, my name is Shared. I'm working on my professional studies degree
        not sure what I want to do yet. Grew up in Utah, really enjoyed the mountains. </p>
    <p>I grew up as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saint's,
        grateful for the opportunity I have had to get to know the Savior and how he loves
        each one of us.</p>
    <p>I like to do crossfit, it's challenging. Working on becoming the person I want to
        be, and relying on God throught my journey because I know I wouldn't be here
        withought him.</p>
